dynamic template through EJS template engine
bootstrap for styling
node.js express
mongoDB -> mongoose
JWT and crystals kyber

i know it's called secure rest API but it's not an api it's an app i changed my mind mid way

/:user/:chatrooms
[user]/userPage
[user]/[chatroom]
[user]/[chatroom]/cha
/:user/createchatroom

once you are logged in, after signup or login, anywhere you go you have /users/:username until jwt expires and have
to login again

make sure only necessary operations are async (doesnt really matter, should still work as expected)

every time a user leaves the room, accepts or declines request. all the operations relating to the database are done 
in the callback function of the HTTP request. for some of these operations, like joining a group. this makes sense.\
but for other operations like declining a request and so on, it doesn't make sense to do the operation directly in the 
callback function. the changes should be cached somewhere, and done later on, like when the user exits the site.

schemas should have validation functions

there should be cleanup for the database, so chatrooms with no members and no admins get deleted off the database.

there should probably be a proper logging system.

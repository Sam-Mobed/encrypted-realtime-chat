*update the package.json file with proper information

*got to make sure user gets redirected to a route, and doesn't just type it in browser URL


dynamic template through EJS template engine
bootstrap for styling
node.js express
mongoDB -> mongoose
JWT and crystals kyber

i know it's called secure rest API but it's not an api it's an app i changed my mind mid way

/:user/:chatrooms
[user]/userPage
[user]/[chatroom]
[user]/[chatroom]/cha
/:user/createchatroom

once you are logged in, after signup or login, anywhere you go you have /users/:username until jwt expires and have
to login again

make sure only necessary operations are async (doesnt really matter, should still work as expected)
